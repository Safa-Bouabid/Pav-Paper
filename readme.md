# Project Name:
	Spatially organized striatum-wide acetylcholine dynamics for the learning and extinction of Pavlovian cues and actions

# glu(iGluSnFR) and G(GRAB-ACh) mice:
	Each `gluXXX` or `GXX` folder contains neural data of one mouse.
	Data are organized into subfolders named after recording session.
	Each subfolder contains two pairs of data (for two recording channels), with each pair consisting of one `MC_ROIs` and one `ttlIn_movie` file.
	`MC_ROIs` files conatins neural signal in the form of fluorescence change extracted from our optic fibers.
	`ttlIn_movie` conatins mouse behavioral data and digital signal collected via the NIDAQ acquisition card.
	
# DL(DLight) mice:
	Each `DLXX` folder contains neural data of one mouse.
	Data are organized into .mat files named after recording session and experimental phases.
	Each .mat file has 3 fields:
		`task_info` contains information of the task of that session
		`roi` contains neural signal in the form of fluorescence, same as `MC_ROIs` mentioned above
		`behavior` contains mouse behavioral data and digital signal of recording system, same as `ttlIn_movie` mentioned above

	These excel sheets contains information of fiber locations of mice.
	Note that iGluSnFR mice only have one fiber whose location is determined via microscopy instead of array fiber localization.
